Only some not important settings for the HTTP blacklists are hardcoded.\r\n\r\nBlacklists can be weighted from 0 to 5. The weight values are added to reach a threshold value of 5 before spam will been blocked. So if configured spam needs to been found on several blacklists before it is blocked.\r\n\r\nAdds a new log for Block actions. Adds logging for email_check_mx.\r\n\r\nAdds a feature to re-check posts and users for spam to the Forum logs, WHO IS ONLINE, MCP -> post details, MCP -> report details and ACP -> Manage users -> Overview.\r\n\r\nAllows to report spammers to HTTP blacklists manually and automatically.\r\n\r\nAdds a feature to require an e-mail address for guest postings. The e-mail address will been displayed only for administrators at the re-check spam pages.\r\n\r\nSupports Contact Board Administration MOD http://www.phpbb.com/customise/db/mod/c ... istration/ to redirect false positives to the contact page.\r\n\r\nSupports Advanced Double Activation Pack MOD to add the Re-check spam feature to the ACP Verify user page.\r\n\r\nSupports Handyman` MOD version check\r\n\r\nTechnical background information:\r\n\r\ndnsbl_check is included in phpBB3 Olympus by default. But it is using the spamhaus.org DNSBL. This list creates a lot of false positives. There are other DNSBLs - e.g. dnsbl.tornevall.org - which are more recommended for the prevention of board spam registrations and spam posts.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
